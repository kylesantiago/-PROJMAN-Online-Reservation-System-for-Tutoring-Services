The topics that were covered in class have a common theme: what are the ethical issues that face different technologies that are available today. All of the presentations stressed that although the technology they were featuring is beneficial to society, we need to use them with caution due to the ethical concerns that they raise. For example, the presentation about Social Media and Freedom of Expression discussed how social media can create positive changes in society, but they also discussed how censorship and regulation could negatively affect people's freedom to express themselves. Another aspect of social media that wasn't explored in great depth is how it can spread hate and bigotry. In Myanmar, Facebook is given for free as a package deal with most of their country's data plans. Because of this, hate speech and misinformation about Rohingya people, a Muslim minority, had spread amongst the general populace. When asked about why they hate the Rohingyas, most people in the street cite the numerous, often false stories of the atrocities that they committed. These stories originated from Facebok, where their authenticity could come into question. Because of this misninformation, the Rohingya community is being violently attacked by the general populace. Facebook has reportedly been slow on taking measures to avoid the spread of this misinformation. I believe that it is important to look at the responsibility that social media companies have with their product, especially because it has become such a large part of people's daily lives.
